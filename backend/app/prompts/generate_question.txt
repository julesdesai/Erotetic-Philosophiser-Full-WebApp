Imagine you are a philosophy professor having a philosophical discussion about the question space surrounding the central question {central_question}.

Generate a new question which critically engages with the current question {random_question}. The question should be clearly and rigorously worded.

The context surrounding this current quesiton is: {context}

Depending on the question, critical engagement might:

- Interrogate the assumptions of the current question
- Ask for consideration of important implications
- Interrogate the logical coherence of the argument

Then generate a brief, one-line summary of the generated question. Make sure the summary is shorter than the question.

Return, separated by a newline only:
